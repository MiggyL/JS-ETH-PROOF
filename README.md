# Token Contract

This Solidity program includes a token system that has a smart contract in the blockchain which is capable of minting and burning tokens that has public variables that saves token details and mapping to keep balances in check.

## Description

The 'MyToken' contract implements a basic token system in which users can create new tokens to increase the total supply and burn existing tokens to decrease it. The contract includes:
- Public variables for storing the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
- A mapping that stores the balance for each address.
- Mints and burns tokens to ensure that the total supply and individual balances are adjusted correctly.
